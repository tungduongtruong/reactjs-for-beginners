React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source JavaScript Library for building User Interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

React is used to build Single Page Applications and React allows us to create reusable UI components.

## 1. History

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, who released an early prototype of React called "FaxJS". It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012. It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013.

Current version of React.JS is V16.13.0 (26 February 2020).

## 2. Virtual DOM

[What is the DOM?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.

A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

Each time you make a change in the code, DOM will be completely updated and rewritten. This is an expensive operation and consumes lots of time. That's why, React provides a solution call is Virtual DOM.

What is the benefit of Virtual DOM?
- React first creates an exact copy of the DOM
- Then React figures out which part is new and only updates that specific part in the Virtual DOM
- Finally, React copies only the new parts of the Virtual DOM to the actual DOM, rather than completely rewriting it.
